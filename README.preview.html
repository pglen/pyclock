<h1>pyclock large LCD alarm clock</h1>
<p>This is an alarm clock that is capable of waking the system<br />
  from sleep before the alarm occurs.</p>
<p>The control of the RTC needs root, so start this as a suid program.</p>
<pre><code>chmod u+s pyclock.py
</code></pre>
<p>The LCD is a crude version of the one I created a decade ago.</p>
